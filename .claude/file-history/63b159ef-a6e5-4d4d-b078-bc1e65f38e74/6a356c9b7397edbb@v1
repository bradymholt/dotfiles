# YNAB Recurring Charges Finder

A React web app that uses the YNAB API to find recurring charges to the same payee. This is helpful for:
- Finding and canceling forgotten subscriptions
- Identifying all recurring charges when a credit card needs to be updated due to fraud

## Features

- Authenticate with your YNAB account using a Personal Access Token
- Select any of your budgets
- Automatically detect recurring charges based on transaction patterns
- View recurring charges sorted by amount
- See transaction history for each recurring charge
- Mobile-responsive design

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your system
- A YNAB account with transaction data

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Get your YNAB Personal Access Token:
   - Go to [YNAB Developer Settings](https://app.ynab.com/settings/developer)
   - Click "New Token" under Personal Access Tokens
   - Enter your password and generate the token
   - Save the token securely (you won't be able to see it again)

### Running the App

Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:5173`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The production build will be in the `dist` folder.

## How to Use

1. Enter your YNAB Personal Access Token on the login screen
2. Select a budget from the dropdown
3. Click "Find Recurring Charges"
4. Browse the detected recurring charges, sorted by average amount
5. Click "View all transactions" to see the full history for each recurring charge

## How It Works

The app analyzes your transactions and identifies recurring charges by:
- Grouping transactions by payee name
- Calculating the average interval between transactions
- Filtering for charges that occur regularly (every 7-400 days)
- Excluding income, transfers, and one-time purchases

## Security Note

Your YNAB Personal Access Token is stored only in your browser's memory and is never sent to any third-party servers. All API calls go directly from your browser to YNAB's API.
